Word memorization game. You can add your own words to practise by changing them in the words.txt. Have fun!

Includes my personal word list as an example.

Your file should have both the word and the translation.
New row for a new word pair, seperate with a comma.
You can seperate synonyms with | symbol.

Example:
file,tiedosto
should,pitäisi
be,olla
like,näin|tykätä|pitää
